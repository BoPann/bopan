# 👋 Welcome to my page!

Hey there! My name’s **Bo**, and I’m currently a **Computer Science graduate student at Seattle University**. My passion lies in **cybersecurity**. I’m working toward becoming a **SOC Analyst**. 

Right now, I’m looking for an **entry-level IT role** such as **SOC Analyst** or **Help Desk Technician** where I can:

1. Gain hands-on experience, and
    
2. Contribute to the cybersecurity community with what I’ve learned so far.
    

I enjoy helping people solve tech problems and learning new ways to secure systems.

In my free time, I like tackling **CTF challenges** — I see them as fun puzzles that sharpen my skills. You’ll find some of my CTF journeys (and struggles!) documented here.

Outside of tech, I love **shooting hoops**, **working out**, **hiking**, and **reading** about topics like health, mindfulness, and fiction. I’m also a huge fan of _The Office_ — I watch clips on YouTube all the time, and who knows, maybe I’ll join an Office trivia night someday! 😄

Here is me and the one and only Prof. David J. Malan from CS50, who has been the inpiration in my learning journey.
